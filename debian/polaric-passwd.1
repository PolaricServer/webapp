.SH NAME
polaric-passwd \- Set or change password of a user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B polaric-passwd
.RI " username"
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
polaric-passwd is an utility for changing passwords used to log in to 
Polaric Server. It is a simple wrapper for 'htpasswd' provided by the Apache
web server software. Please note that you hav to manually add user to 
permissions list in /etc/polaric-aprsd/server.ini and (possibly) to 
/etc/polaric-webapp/kamap-setup.ph to grant access to the user. I hope to 
automate this in later versions.
